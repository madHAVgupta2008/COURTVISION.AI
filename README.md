# COURTVISION.AI
An AI-powered mobile application that turns a smartphone into a real-time tennis referee. Designed for recreational players who don’t have access to line judges or Hawk-Eye systems.
📌 Overview

AI Referee for Amateurs is a mobile app that uses a smartphone camera placed at mid-court to automatically detect:

✅ Out-of-bounds shots

✅ Foot faults

✅ Ball trajectory

✅ Real-time line calls

The app provides fair, instant, and unbiased decisions — making amateur matches more professional and dispute-free.

The app uses computer vision and AI to:

Detect the tennis ball

Track its trajectory

Identify court boundary lines

Determine if the ball is IN or OUT

Detect foot faults during serves

Provide instant visual and audio feedback
